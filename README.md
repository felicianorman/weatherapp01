This was done following a Youtube Tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZNG8UomjSI&ab_channel=JonahLawrence%E2%80%A2DevProTips), 
and taught me the basics of using an API. It also taught me new ways to use JavaScript.

The code is mainly from the tutorial, except some small changes by me. The point of uploading it to Github is so I can go back and look at the code and continue to learn from it, and show my friends what a cool project I managed to pull off (with help). :)
